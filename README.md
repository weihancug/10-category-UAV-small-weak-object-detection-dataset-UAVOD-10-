# 10-category-UAV-small-weak-object-detection-dataset-UAVOD-10-
This repository is about downloading and using the UAVOD-10 dataset, which will be available on [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GlEiHENSAcG2V8bthTUn6A) or [Google Driver](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GlEiHENSAcG2V8bthTUn6A) after the relevant paper is published.


The UAVOD-10 consists of 844 images and 18,234 instances. These instances are labeled with horizontal bounding boxs (HBB) with VOC format. The imagesâ€™ widths range from 1,000 to 4,800 pixels, and their resolutions are about 0.15 meters. Some examples of the 10-class objects are displayed in the figure. The 10 categories of objects are building, ship, vehicle, prefabricated house, well, cable tower, pool, landslide, cultivation mesh cage, and quarry.
